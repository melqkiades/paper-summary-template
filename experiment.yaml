    goals: 
        - Improve code search done with nautal language.
    key_elements:
        - Embedding code documentation and source code embeddings into the same representation. In other words, the source code embedding and its corresponding documentation embedding will have similar vectors.
        - A unified representation of heterogeneous data.
        - Reinforcer-transformer architecture.
        - Better query understanding through deep learning.
        - Clustering snippets by natural language semantics.
    thing_to_use:
        - Embedding documentation and source code into the same space is a powerful idea.
    thoughts:
        - Depending on the application it can also be used for our project.
